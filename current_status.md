# Current Status of Issue #11: CI and Testing Improvements

## Original Issue (#11) Goals:
- Introduce GitHub Actions to automatically run `pytest` and linting.
- Expand tests to cover major modules, mocking external API calls.
- Introduce coverage measurement to quantify quality.

## Steps Taken So Far:
1.  **GitHub Actions CI Setup:** Created `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to run on `push` and `pull_request` events. Configured to set up Python 3.11, install dependencies, run `ruff` for linting, and `pytest` with `pytest-cov` for testing and coverage.
2.  **Initial Test Addition:** Added `tests/test_generate_ai_dimensions.py` to test a module that uses `GeminiClient`, with mocking for the API calls.
3.  **Model-Dependent Test Skipping:** Modified `tests/test_category_theory.py` to skip tests if ML models (EfficientNet, MobileNet, MobileViT, ResNet) are not found locally. This addresses the issue of large models not being present in the CI environment.
4.  **Test File Renaming:** Renamed `tools/test_vector_generation.py` to `tools/run_vector_generation_test.py` to prevent `pytest` from incorrectly trying to run it as a test.
5.  **Fixed GiNZA Installation in CI:** Modified `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to install the `ja_ginza` model directly from its GitHub release URL. This was done to fix an issue where `pip` was unable to correctly find and install the model in the CI environment.

## Resolution of GiNZA Issue
The problem where GiNZA failed to extract concepts in the CI environment has been addressed. The issue was traced to `pip`'s inability to reliably download the `ja_ginza` model package. The fix involved modifying the `ci.yml` workflow to bypass the package resolution and instead install the model directly from its GitHub release wheel file using `pip`. This ensures the model is always available for tests that depend on it.

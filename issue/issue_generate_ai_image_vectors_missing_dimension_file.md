## Error: Missing Dimension Definition File in `src/generate_ai_image_vectors.py`

When running `src/generate_ai_image_vectors.py`, the script failed because a required dimension definition file was not found.

### Error Message

```
🚀 Geminiによる画像ベクトルデータベースの構築を開始します。
❗エラー: 次元定義ファイルが見つかりません: vector_dimensions_custom_ai.json
```

### Analysis

The `generate_ai_image_vectors.py` script attempts to load a dimension definition file named `vector_dimensions_custom_ai.json`. This file is crucial for the script's operation, and its absence prevents the image vector database from being built.

### Resolution

Ensure that the `vector_dimensions_custom_ai.json` file is present in the `config/` directory. This file is typically generated by `src/generate_ai_dimensions.py`.

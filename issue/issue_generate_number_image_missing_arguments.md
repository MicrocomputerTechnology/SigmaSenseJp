## Error: Missing Required Arguments in `src/generate_number_image.py`

When running `src/generate_number_image.py`, the script failed due to missing required command-line arguments.

### Error Message

```
Usage: python generate_number_image.py <number> <output_path>
```

### Analysis

The `generate_number_image.py` script requires two positional arguments: `<number>` (the number to be generated as an image) and `<output_path>` (the path to save the generated image). These arguments are not optional, and their absence causes the script to terminate with an error.

### Resolution

To run this script successfully, both the `<number>` and `<output_path>` arguments must be provided. For example:
`python src/generate_number_image.py 5 sigma_images/number_5.png`

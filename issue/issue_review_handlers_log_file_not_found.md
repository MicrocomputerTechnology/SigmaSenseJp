## Warning: Log File Not Found in `tools/review_handlers.py`

When running `tools/review_handlers.py`, a warning was issued because a required log file was not found.

### Warning Message

```
ログファイルが見つかりません: /sdcard/project/SigmaSenseJp/tools/../sigma_logs/permanentization_log.jsonl
```

### Analysis

The `review_handlers.py` script attempts to read a log file named `permanentization_log.jsonl` from the `sigma_logs` directory. This file was not found, which likely means that the permanentization process has not been run yet, or the log file was deleted.

### Resolution

Ensure that the `permanentization_log.jsonl` file exists in the `sigma_logs/` directory. This file is typically generated by processes related to handler permanentization.

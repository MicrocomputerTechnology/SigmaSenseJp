## Error: Missing Required Argument in `run_narrative_analysis.py`

When running `scripts/run_narrative_analysis.py`, the script failed due to a missing required command-line argument.

### Error Message

```
usage: run_narrative_analysis.py [-h] [--log_file LOG_FILE] subject
run_narrative_analysis.py: error: the following arguments are required: subject
```

### Analysis

The script `run_narrative_analysis.py` requires a positional argument `subject` to be provided when executed. This argument is not optional, and its absence causes the script to terminate with an error.

### Resolution

To run this script successfully, the `subject` argument must be provided. For example:
`python scripts/run_narrative_analysis.py "some_subject_text"`

## Error: Missing Database File in `run_sheaf_analysis.py`

When running `scripts/run_sheaf_analysis.py`, the script failed because a required database file was not found.

### Error Message

```
--- Running Sheaf Analysis on: multi_object.jpg ---
Error: Database file not found at /sdcard/project/SigmaSenseJp/config/sigma_product_database_custom_ai_generated.json
```

### Analysis

The `run_sheaf_analysis.py` script attempts to load a database file from `/sdcard/project/SigmaSenseJp/config/sigma_product_database_custom_ai_generated.json`, but this file does not exist. This suggests that the database has not been built yet, or the path to the database is incorrect.

### Resolution

Before running `run_sheaf_analysis.py`, the database needs to be built, likely by running `src/build_database.py` or a similar script that generates `sigma_product_database_custom_ai_generated.json`.

## Error: Missing Required Argument in `tools/run_vector_generation_test.py`

When running `tools/run_vector_generation_test.py`, the script failed due to a missing required command-line argument.

### Error Message

```
usage: run_vector_generation_test.py [-h] image_path
run_vector_generation_test.py: error: the following arguments are required: image_path
```

### Analysis

The script `run_vector_generation_test.py` requires a positional argument `image_path` to be provided when executed. This argument is not optional, and its absence causes the script to terminate with an error.

### Resolution

To run this script successfully, the `image_path` argument must be provided. For example:
`python tools/run_vector_generation_test.py sigma_images/circle_center.jpg`

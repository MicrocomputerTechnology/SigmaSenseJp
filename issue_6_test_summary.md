## Current Status Update:

The `test_sheaf_axioms.py` is still failing. The root cause is the flawed test setup with overlapping squares, which makes it difficult to isolate the hue of individual colors for accurate testing of the "gluing axiom".

- The `sigma_image_engines/engine_opencv_legacy.py` and `src/build_database.py` files are currently in their original state.
- The test `test_gluing_semantic_consistency` needs to be re-evaluated. It might be better to test the hue detection on *isolated* color patches first, and then separately test the "gluing axiom" with a more robust method that doesn't rely on simple hue dominance in overlapping regions.
